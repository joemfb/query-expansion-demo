# Query Expansion Demo

This app showcases an approach to semantic query expansion. It's based on the  MarkLogic-Node [Slush](https://github.com/klei/slush) generator, but enhanced with a client-search search phrase parser. This allows the client full control over the query-expansion, and an opportunity to visualize the mechanism of that expansion.

The parser grammer (PEG.js) is included (search.peg).
